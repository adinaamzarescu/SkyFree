**Game**

The player will ski down the slope. 
Obstacles will appear in his way:
  * Trees
  * Lampposts
  * Stones
  
Gifts will also appear on the way. The goal of the player 
is to collect as many gifts as possible. Each object has 
a unique texture, these being found in the "textures" 
directory.

When the player encounters an obstacle or goes off 
the slope, the game will stop and the final score 
will be displayed.
